#Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

Objective 1:  Find a spot where an arbitrary file can be uploaded in the Damn Vulnerable Overpoweringly Cute Cat App.

Objective 2:  Write a jsp that takes an arbitrary command from the user as a parameter and executes it.  Upload this to the DVOCCA to exploit this vulnerability.

Objective 3:  Look into how to use Laudanum (http://sourceforge.net/projects/laudanum/) to upload a shell that only you can use.  *When pentesting it is a good idea not to leave open doors that others can exploit.  Laudanum allows you to test the vulnerability without leaving the site more vulnerable than before.

Objective 4:  Look into how to fix the code so that arbitrary files cannot be uploaded and executed.  Consider how to tell if a file is a valid jpg.  There are different levels this can be taken to, but come up with an improvement and test it.
