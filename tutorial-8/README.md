Objective 1: Find and execute a CSRF vulnerability in the Damn Vulnerable Overpoweringly Cute Cat App.  Use another application to execute the CSRF.  Remember the user must be logged in for it to execute.

Objective 2: Fix the CSRF in the DVOCCA.  Verify it no longer executes.  Consider fixing this using either SPring Security or OWASP's ESAPI.

Objective 3: Change the registration and passsword reset options to support password hashing algorithms matching the cas tutorials.
