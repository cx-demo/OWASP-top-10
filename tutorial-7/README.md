#Missing Function Level Access Control

Objective 1: Find something that you can access in the Damn Vulenrable Overpoweringly Cute Cat App that you should not be able to access.  This may be something that your user type should not be able to access (IE admin funcionality) or data that is private for another user.

Objective 2: Fix this so that you can not access this anymore.  You may want to use look at using Spring Security or OWASP's ESAPI to help with this.
