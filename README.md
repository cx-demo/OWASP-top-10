# OWASP-top-10
A look at finding and fixing the OWASP top 10 in the Damn Vulnerable Cute Cat Application

This group of tutorials requires going through the second CAS-tutorial first, and builds on the app used in the second CAS-tutorial.
Please complete the 2nd CAS-tutorial before proceeding as you will need the code created there to proceed.

Each tutorial has README, which explains the objectives.  Each tutorial will also have either slides, links to videos or blog posts to help walk through the information.  Then if code corrections are part of it there are sample code corrections included showing one way to fix the issue.  There may be many ways available.

The code in the Damn Vulnerable Overpoweringly Cute Cat App is poorly written on purpose to include security vulnerabilities, and thus should never be used in ay application accept for learning.  Further the code breaks several rules of good design and structure, so please do not use it as guide except for on how to find and fix security vulnerabilties.
